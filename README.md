# Reachout for help with using ocean parcels

Either I am missing something fundamental (quite likely) or there is a bug or similar (not so likely) with the loading of 3D nemo output dataset into OceanParcels

This repository is to define a test case showing my problem.

To make it work, do `ln -s <path-to-ocean-parcels-examples directory>` or execute `parcels_get_examples parcels_examples` in this directory.
